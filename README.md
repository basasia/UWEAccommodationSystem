# UWEAccommodationSystem
Virtual Accommodation System for UWE developed by using JAVA 

###Accommodation app for the university system

##Task

Build an application that allows three different types of account to login which are warden, hall manager and admin to control the status and detail of the rooms within the accommodation of the university. Each account type will have different functionalities.

##Summary 

This application was built using Netbeans and SceneBuilder. Netbeans comes with JAVA and JAVAFX programming language which allows me to implement the back-end of the application based on the principle of object oriented programming such as treating each room as an object and each functionality as a method within the class. SceneBuilder was also used for implementing this application, the user interface and layout were all designed using SceneBuilder combined with JAVAFX for linking all the functionality from the back-end with the front-end of the application.

##Functionality

This application simulates the accommodation system of the university in which it can be login with three main account types that are warden, hall manger and admin. Warden can view hall details, view room detail, view and change cleaning status. Hall manager can view hall details, view and edit room details, view and edit lease details. Lasty, Admin can do everything like both hall manager and warden.

##Design

The design of this application followed the basic pattern of regular application such that it has login interface with clearly intructions on how to login, every buttons has it own label describes what is it and the application has an error handling functionality that display an pop-up error messages when the user raised some errors.
